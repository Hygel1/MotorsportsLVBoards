# MotorsportsLVBoards

LV Board repository for Motorsports created 09.02.2025

BE SURE TO COMMIT & PUSH ALL CHANGES WHEN FINISHED TO KEEP THINGS UPDATED

******ComponentLib - Upload all components used here, if you know that you've deleted the last instance of a component, move it to 'OLD' (otherwise we'll eventually end up with a ton of unused components that people are loading every time for no reason)
****** I don't think this is actually necessary it looks like every project file comes with a cache of all used components and their traits but i'm gonna leave it in for now 
    -- IF A SCHEMATIC DOESN'T LOAD BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE COMPONENTS LET ME KNOW AND ILL GO THROUGH AND FIX IT

LV Boards are now 'modulated' - this means that each board is designed to serve a single purpose so that individual circuits/functions can be easily replaced
    This means that wires need to be obviosuly labeled with their purpose and output params/types to keep things 'open source' enough that it can be easily updated -- keep documentation (wiring diagram, code comments, standalone documentation) updated, descriptive, and accurate
