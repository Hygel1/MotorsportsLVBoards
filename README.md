# MotorsportsLVBoards

LV Board repository for Motorsports created 09.02.2025

BE SURE TO COMMIT & PUSH ALL CHANGES WHEN FINISHED TO KEEP THINGS UPDATED

******ComponentLib - Upload all components used here, if you know that you've deleted the last instance of a component, move it to 'OLD' (otherwise we'll eventually end up with a ton of unused components that people are loading every time for no reason)
****** I don't think this is actually necessary it looks like every project file comes with a cache of all used components and their traits but i'm gonna leave it in for now 
    -- IF A SCHEMATIC DOESN'T LOAD BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE COMPONENTS LET ME KNOW AND ILL GO THROUGH AND FIX IT

LV Boards are now 'modulated' - this means that each board is designed to serve a single purpose so that individual circuits/functions can be easily replaced
    This means that wires need to be obviosuly labeled with their purpose and output params/types to keep things 'open source' enough that it can be easily updated -- keep documentation (wiring diagram, code comments, standalone documentation) updated, descriptive, and accurate

To use this and work on the board (non cmd because if you don't know this you don't need to be trying to do it on the console):  
    - make a github account   
        - you can do this with your school email or your personal but if you plan on making changes, make your screen name traceable (eg. we want to be able to know who's doing stuff)  
    - download github for desktop (https://desktop.github.com/download/) and sign in  
    - 'follow' this repository to add it to your account  
    - click current repository (top left) --> add --> clone repository --> pull origin  
    - find your file path (repository --> show in explorer) and open whatever you want  
    - if you make changes, YOU NEED TO MANUALLY UPDATE THE REPOSITORY, ALL CHANGES MADE ARE LOCAL UNTIL THIS IS DONE  
        - go back to your github app and open the repository (its probably still open), add a summary and commit your changes, push to origin  
        - MAKE YOUR SUMMARY SOMEWHAT DETAILED, YOU DON'T NEED A PARAGRAPH BUT THIS IS A REALLY GOOD PLACE TO PUT A CHANGE LOG SO WE CAN TRACK WHATS HAPPENING WHEN AND GET A SOMEWHAT DETAILED HISTORY
